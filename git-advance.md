pull request
------------

work in proffessional ways have multipule branches which are used to 
production , devlopment , testing etc
so when working on testing branch and want to merge it into devlopment we used
to create pull request and so when reviewer see and compare changes if these ok then it will merge it into deployment branch its calld pull request

Forking
-------

when you want to work on someone else's repository on which you dont have write access, you create fork of it

this is mostly done with pulic projects where community contributes

you just go to repos which you want to fork and press the button fork 

fork will create a repos copy and create your account repos

now you can write code on it and push changes and comment on your repos so
if you want to send these changes to owner you can create pull request 
and send him for merge .........
