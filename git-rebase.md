when you dont want to make detail history like created dev branch from master and then make some commits and create new branch feature form dev branch and make commits and then merge feature into dev and then dev into master...in rebase it show just only master brach althoug you have worked like mention but with rebase marge it didnt retain history it just show only master branch take all commits......

    $git rebase <branch-name>

    $git rebase dev
